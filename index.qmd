title: "So what's this all about then?"

I decided to give the [30 Day Map Challenge](https://30daymapchallenge.com/) a go as a learning exercise. My efforts are certainly not an exercise in flashy or impressive cartographic design.

I've been teaching with `tmap` for a few years. Version 4.0 is in the offing and introduces some major changes, which at first glance make it trickier to teach, and closer in many ways to `ggplot2`, which I have often considered instead. 

So... I thought I'd make a bunch of maps using both platforms to get a feel for the pros and cons of each.

As the month wore on, I tried a few other things, there being only so many things to explore in comparing tools primarily focused on relatively simple thematic mapping.
