I decided to give the [30 Day Map Challenge](https://30daymapchallenge.com/) a go this year. My efforts are certainly not an exercise in flashy or impressive cartographic design. I've been teaching with `tmap` for a few years. Version 4.0 is due soon and includes major changes, which at first glance make it more similar in many ways to `ggplot2`, which I have often considered instead. So... I thought I'd make some simple maps using both platforms to get a feel for the pros and cons of each.

As the month wore on, I tried some other things, there being only so many things to explore using tools focused on relatively simple thematic mapping.
