My efforts are certainly not an exercise in flashy or impressive cartographic design.\nI’ve been teaching with tmap for a few years. Version 4.0 is in the offing and introduces some major changes, which at first glance make it trickier to teach, and closer in many ways to ggplot2, which I have often considered instead.\nSo… I thought I’d make a bunch of maps using both platforms to get a feel for the pros and cons of each."

Turns out… it’s complicated. tmap uses 0.75 points, and ggplot2 uses ~0.75 millimetres.\nWait, wut? 0.75 pts and approximately 0.75 mm?! Yes, you read that correctly.\nTo be fair to tmap, it’s using the R graphics standard, which is that lwd is specified in pixels, which is notionally 1/96 inch, as laid down by CSS. This is ‘device dependent’ and when it comes to getting plots out of R and into image file formats can lead to all kinds of headaches, but that’s another story. A point is 1/72 inch, so lwd = 1 gives you nominal line widths of 0.75 points in tmap.\nMeanwhile, according to the ggplot2 documentation (RTFM, eh?)\n\nDue to a historical error, the unit of linewidth is roughly 0.75 mm. Making it exactly 1 mm would change a very large number of existing plots, so we’re stuck with this mistake.\n\nThey say nothing more on the matter. Presumably, it’s something to do with that 1/72 vs 1/96 thing just noted, and perhaps the approximately is due to TeX’s use of a point being 1/72.27 inches, which is apparently more historically accurate, and was the approximation settled upon, because it is palindromic! OK… welll maybe not really that last bit.\nAnyway, the magic number 72.27 is buried in the ggplot2 code, where the conversion factor 72.27 / 25.4 is baked in. I was led to this information by this stackoverflow post.\nThe upshot of all this? To get the same line widths in ggplot2 as in tmap multiply by 25.4 / 72.27.
