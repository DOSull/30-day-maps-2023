My efforts are certainly not an exercise in flashy or impressive cartographic design.\nI’ve been teaching with tmap for a few years. Version 4.0 is in the offing and introduces some major changes, which at first glance make it trickier to teach, and closer in many ways to ggplot2, which I have often considered instead.\nSo… I thought I’d make a bunch of maps using both platforms to get a feel for the pros and cons of each."

    "text": "How I made it\nSo what I did was to take a DEM, and find valley floors and ridge lines. For this I used the Whitebox Tools geomorphons tool. There may be better option but this worked for me. I can demonstrate this in R:\n\nlibrary(terra)\nlibrary(whitebox)\nlibrary(tmap)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nwbt_geomorphons(\"data/dem.tif\", \"data/geomorphons.tif\", search = 20)\n\ngeomorphons &lt;- rast(\"data/geomorphons.tif\")\ninset_area &lt;- ext(geomorphons) - rep(160, 4)\n\ntm_shape(geomorphons %&gt;% crop(inset_area) %&gt;% flip(direction = \"vertical\")) + \n  tm_raster(\n    col.scale = tm_scale_intervals(\n      values = \"RdBu\", n = 10)\n  ) +\n  tm_layout(\n    frame = FALSE, \n    legend.show = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\nThe blue areas in the map are valley floors, the red areas ridge tops. It so happens that in origami, red and blue lines are often used in crease patterns to distinguish mountain folds and valley folds. So pinching the blue linear features into creases and from the reverse side (i.e., through the back of the printed page) pinching the red linear features into creases gives the ‘crumpled’ sheet I want.\nSo anyway, I printed the map on a sheet of paper, and then made the folds. Here’s another example."

It also required some care lighting the picture to avoid ‘terrain inversion’, and I’m not even sure it avoids that entirely. It’s very clear in real life which parts of the landscape are ‘up’.\nI’ve experimented a little with the approach, and it seems to work better on more highly dissected terrain."

Turns out… it’s complicated. tmap uses 0.75 points, and ggplot2 uses ~0.75 millimetres.\nWait, wut? 0.75 pts and approximately 0.75 mm?! Yes, you read that correctly.\nTo be fair to tmap, it’s using the R graphics standard, which is that lwd is specified in pixels, which is notionally 1/96 inch, as laid down by CSS. This is ‘device dependent’ and when it comes to getting plots out of R and into image file formats can lead to all kinds of headaches, but that’s another story. A point is 1/72 inch (ever since Adobe made it so), so lwd = 1 gives you nominal line widths of 0.75 points in tmap.\nMeanwhile, according to the ggplot2 documentation (RTFM, eh?)\n\nDue to a historical error, the unit of linewidth is roughly 0.75 mm. Making it exactly 1 mm would change a very large number of existing plots, so we’re stuck with this mistake.\n\nThey say nothing more on the matter. Presumably, it’s something to do with that 1/72 vs 1/96 thing just noted, and perhaps the approximately is due to TeX’s use of a point being 1/72.27 inches, which is apparently more historically accurate, and was the approximation settled upon, because it is palindromic! OK… welll maybe not really that last bit.\nAnyway, the magic number 72.27 is buried in the ggplot2 code, where the conversion factor 72.27 / 25.4 is baked in. I was led to this information by this stackoverflow post.\nThe upshot of all this? To get the same line widths in ggplot2 as in tmap multiply by 25.4 / 72.27.
