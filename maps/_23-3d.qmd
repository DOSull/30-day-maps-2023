The third dimension.

Or the illusion thereof.

I wanted to do another tiled map, and I have always loved the use of colour-wheel based spectral schemes for symbolising 'aspect' in hill terrain model contexts. So here is a not-really-a-map which combines those two things.

This one uses the `hex-dissection` tiling method, mentioned in passing in [this presentation](https://dosull.github.io/weaving-space/NZCS-Aug-2022/slides/#/hexagon-dissections-and-colourings). The spectral 'colour wheel' symbolisation of aspect is genius, first proposed in

> Moellering H and AJ Kimerling,1990, A new digital slope-aspect display process. _Cartography and Geographic Information Systems_ **17**(2) 151-159.

and later detailed by

> Brewer CA and KA Marlow. 1993. [Color representation of aspect and slope simultaneously](https://cartogis.org/docs/proceedings/archive/auto-carto-11/pdf/color-representation-of-aspect-and-slope-simultaneously.pdf) pages 328-337 in RB McMaster and MP Armstrong (eds.) _Auto-Carto 11 Proceedings of the International Symposium On Computer-Assisted Cartography_.

When I came across this on the cover of [_Visualization in Modern Cartography_] (confusingly not a topic covered in that book), it was one of those aha! moments.

In the papers  cited above (but not, confusingly in any chapter of that book) they discuss more saturated spectral schemes. An instance where maybe it's OK for cartographers to use a rainbow palette. Here for simplicity's sake I'm using the ColorBrewer `Spectral` palette.
