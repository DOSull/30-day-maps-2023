Sketch map of Wellington. In my defence... I've only lived here 5 years and Wellington's street plan is _bonkers_. 

Even allowing that, this is pretty bad. Somehow or other Wellington's road network has never lodged itself properly in my head. I can find my way around, but I struggle to point in the right direction to places when asked.

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=10}
#| code-fold: true
library(sf)
library(tmap)

scope <- list(matrix(c(1.746e6, 1.75e6, 1.75e6, 1.746e6, 1.746e6,
                       5.424e6, 5.428e6, 5.428e6, 5.424e6, 5.424e6), 
                       nc = 2)) %>%
  st_polygon() %>%
  st_sfc(crs = 2193) %>%
  st_sf()

tm_shape(scope) +
  tm_fill(fill_alpha = 0) + 
  tm_basemap() +
  tm_layout(inner.margins = rep(0, 4), frame = FALSE)
```
